# yayabot
This is just a fun bot I made for me and my friends :D.
Feel free to add it to your server.
## Basic use
yayabot isn't really a general purpose bot, it really just responds to certain triggers with memes, images, and gifs.
- To see said triggers, type `!help`.
- Also, to change the prefix, type `!prefix <symbol(s)>`. (Replace `<symbol(s)>` with the symbol(s) you would like to use as the prefix.) Suggestions: `!`, `.`, `,`, `/`, etc.
## Support/Suggestions
There is no support server, website, or command. If you need support or help, or have suggestions for things to add to the bot, please DM my Discord account (my username is `theonetruenugget.`), or add an issue to the Issues tab on the Github page (this one).
# Other notes
THERE ARE NO OTHER OFFICIAL YAYABOT WEBSITES OR CONTACT METHODS. ANY OTHERS YOU SEE ARE EITHER FAKE, OR REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT PRODUCT.
Again, if you have issues or concerns, feel free to [DM me on Discord](https://discord.com/users/978055148091867157), or send an issue request [here](https://github.com/jddivoky/yaya-bot/issues).
